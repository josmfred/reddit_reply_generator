The get_data notebook collects and cleans the data.
The learn notebook trains each model, and contains the comment generator
The explore notebook contains some sentiment exploration and the upvote model's embdding plotting.
The file Presentation.pptx contains the presentation slides for the in-class presentation.

Note: Each notebook does not need to fun in full. For example, the learning notebook would take hours to
      retrain each network. The notebooks should most likely be run starting at the batch loads part way into the notebooks.
